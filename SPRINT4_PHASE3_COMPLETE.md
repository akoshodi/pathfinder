### Backend Updates
- **Updated**: `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/BlogPostController.php`

  - `edit()`: Now fetches and passes users list
  - `store()`: Updated validation to include slug, author_id, meta_title, meta_description
  - `update()`: Updated validation to match store method with unique slug rule

- **Updated**: `app/Models/BlogPost.php`
  - Added `author_id`, `meta_title`, `meta_description` to fillable array
  - Fixed `author()` relationship to use `author_id` instead of `user_id`

## Key Features Implemented

### Forms
1. **Complete Field Coverage**: All fields match controller validation rules
2. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
3. **Loading States**: Forms show opacity reduction and disabled buttons during submission
4. **Validation Feedback**: Error messages display below each field
5. **Smart Defaults**: Active status defaults to true; proper handling of nullable fields
6. **Array Handling**: Comma-separated inputs for tags and eligibility requirements with proper transformation

### UX Enhancements
1. **Back Navigation**: Consistent back links to list pages
2. **Visual Feedback**: Processing state changes button text and disables interaction
3. **Dark Mode Support**: All form elements styled for both light and dark themes
4. **Responsive Layout**: Forms use grid layout that adapts to screen size

### Data Flow
1. **Form Submission**: Data is transformed before submission (arrays from comma-separated strings, numeric conversions)
2. **Toast Notifications**: Controllers flash success messages that are automatically displayed by global Toast component
3. **Redirect**: After successful create/update, users are redirected to the index page

## Next Steps

### Pending Features
1. **Bulk Actions**: Wire DataTable selection and bulk delete functionality
2. **CSV Export**: Add export endpoints and UI buttons
3. **Loading States on Index Pages**: Pass loading prop to DataTable during navigation
4. **Tests**: Create feature tests for Competition and Blog Post CRUD operations

### Technical Debt
- Pint formatter returns exit code 130 (needs investigation)
- Consider rich text editor for blog post content field
- Consider image upload functionality instead of URL inputs
- Add slug auto-generation from title

## Testing Checklist
