# Career Assessment System - Implementation Progress

## Overview
Building a comprehensive Career and Skills Assessment System that helps users discover careers aligned with their interests, skills, and personality traits, integrated with ONET occupational database.

## âœ… Completed Components

### 1. Database Schema (Migration: 2025_10_29_183330)
Created 10 tables for comprehensive assessment system:

- **assessment_types**: Defines RIASEC, Skills, Personality, Career Fit assessments
- **assessment_questions**: Question bank with scoring_map JSON
- **user_assessment_attempts**: Tracks progress and scores
- **user_assessment_responses**: Individual answers
- **new_assessment_reports**: Generated insights and summaries
- **career_recommendations**: Links to ONET occupations with match scores
- **riasec_scores**: Holland Code results (R, I, A, S, E, C)
- **skill_proficiencies**: Skill domain evaluations
- **personality_traits**: Big Five or MBTI results
- **assessment_analytics**: Aggregate stats

### 2. Eloquent Models (9 models with full relationships)

#### AssessmentType
- `questions()`, `attempts()`, `completedAttempts()` relationships
- `scopeActive()` for filtering active assessments

#### UserAssessmentAttempt
- 7 relationships: user, assessmentType, responses, report, riasecScore, skillProficiencies, personalityTrait
- `calculateProgress()` method for completion percentage
- `scopeCompleted()`, `scopeInProgress()` for filtering

#### RiasecScore
- `getTopThreeCodes()` - returns top 3 Holland Codes sorted
- `getAllScores()` - returns all 6 dimension scores
- `getHollandCodeAttribute()` - e.g., "RIA"

#### CareerRecommendation
- Foreign key to ONET occupation data
- `scopeTopRanked($limit)`, `scopeHighMatch($threshold)`
- Stores match_score, skill_gaps, learning_paths

#### SkillProficiency
- `getProficiencyPercentage()`, `isStrength()`, `needsImprovement()`
- Domain-based skill evaluation

#### PersonalityTrait
- `getBigFiveScores()`, `getPersonalitySummary()`
- Natural language trait analysis

### 3. Services Layer

#### RiasecScoringService
- `calculateScores($attempt)`: Calculates Holland Code scores from responses
- `getCodeDescriptions()`: Full metadata for R, I, A, S, E, C
- `getScoreDistribution($riasecScore)`: Percentage distribution

#### CareerMatchingService
- `matchCareersFromRiasec()`: Queries ONET database for matching occupations
- `matchCareersFromSkills()`: Matches based on skill proficiencies
- `calculateMatchScore()`: Weighted scoring algorithm (0-100)
- `identifySkillGaps()`: Compares user skills to occupation requirements
- `getEducationRequirements()`: Pulls from ONET education data
- `suggestLearningPaths()`: Recommends courses/certifications

#### ReportGenerationService
- `generate($attempt)`: Orchestrates complete report generation
- `generateRiasecScores()`, `generateSkillScores()`, `generatePersonalityScores()`
- `generateSummary()`: Natural language assessment summary
- `generateInsights()`: Detailed trait descriptions
- `generateVisualizationData()`: Chart data (radar, bar graphs)
- `generateCareerRecommendations()`: Calls CareerMatchingService

### 4. Controllers

#### AssessmentController
- `index()`: Lists available assessments + recent attempts
- `start($slug)`: Creates new attempt or resumes incomplete
- `take($attempt)`: Displays assessment questions
- `answer($attempt)`: Saves individual responses with scoring
- `complete($attempt)`: Marks complete and triggers report generation
- `results($attempt)`: Displays comprehensive results with RIASEC scores and career recommendations

Supports both authenticated and anonymous users (session-based).

### 5. Seeders

#### AssessmentTypeSeeder
Created 4 assessment types:
- RIASEC Career Interest Assessment (60 questions, 15 min)
- Skills Assessment (50 questions, 20 min)
- Personality Assessment (50 questions, 15 min)
- Comprehensive Career Fit Analysis (composite)

#### RiasecQuestionSeeder
Created 60 RIASEC questions (10 per Holland Code dimension):
- Realistic (R): Hands-on, mechanical, outdoor work
- Investigative (I): Research, analysis, problem-solving
- Artistic (A): Creative expression, design, originality
- Social (S): Helping, teaching, empathy
- Enterprising (E): Leadership, persuasion, competition
- Conventional (C): Structure, data management, accuracy

Each question uses 5-point Likert scale with scoring_map JSON.

### 6. Routes (web.php)
```php
GET  /assessments                    - List assessments
POST /assessments/{slug}/start       - Start assessment
GET  /assessments/{attempt}/take     - Take assessment
POST /assessments/{attempt}/answer   - Submit answer
POST /assessments/{attempt}/complete - Complete & generate report
GET  /assessments/{attempt}/results  - View results
```

## ðŸš§ Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (MVP)
1. **React UI Components** (resources/js/Pages/Assessments/)
   - `Index.tsx`: Assessment cards with descriptions
   - `Take.tsx`: Question display with progress bar
   - `Results.tsx`: RIASEC radar chart, career matches, insights

2. **Testing**
   - Feature test: Complete RIASEC assessment end-to-end
   - Test scoring algorithm accuracy
   - Test ONET career matching

3. **Skills Assessment Implementation**
   - Create SkillScoringService
   - Seed 50 questions across 5 domains (Cognitive, Technical, Social, Management, Creative)
   - Implement domain-based proficiency calculation

4. **Personality Assessment Implementation**
   - Create PersonalityScoringService
   - Seed 50 Big Five questions (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Emotional Stability)
   - Natural language personality summary generation

### Medium Priority
5. **Career Fit Analysis Engine**
   - CareerFitService combining all 3 assessment types
   - Weighted scoring algorithm (40% interests, 35% skills, 25% personality)

6. **PDF Export**
   - Use Spatie Laravel PDF (spatie/laravel-pdf)
   - Create PDF view template with results, charts, recommendations

7. **Learning Path Integration**
   - Link career recommendations to existing courses/programs in database
   - Generate personalized skill development roadmaps

### Low Priority
8. **Admin Analytics Dashboard**
   - Track completion rates per assessment type
   - Popular career matches
   - Common skill gaps
   - Update assessment_analytics table daily

9. **Polish & UX**
   - Adaptive question ordering based on responses
   - Save progress automatically every N seconds
   - Email results to authenticated users
   - Social sharing of Holland Code

## Architecture Notes

### ONET Integration Strategy
- RIASEC matching uses `onet_interests` table with occupational interest scale
- Skills matching queries `onet_skills` table with importance ratings (â‰¥3.5)
- Education requirements from `onet_education_training_experience`
- Match scores calculated using weighted algorithms (interest_match, skill_matches)

### Scoring Algorithm
1. User completes assessment â†’ responses stored
2. Service retrieves responses with questions (includes scoring_map)
3. For each response: look up scoring_map[response_value] â†’ {"R": 3, "I": 1, ...}
4. Aggregate scores per dimension (R, I, A, S, E, C or domain)
5. Sort scores to identify top 3 codes/domains
6. Create score record with primary/secondary/tertiary codes

### Flexibility
- JSON columns (scoring_map, options, metadata) allow easy question modifications
- Service layer pattern separates business logic from controllers
- Assessment categories extensible (career_interest, skills, personality, custom)

  â””â”€â”€ occupation (BelongsTo OnetOccupation via onetsoc_code FK)
```

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Session-based for anonymous users**: Allows taking assessments without account
2. **Separate attempts from results**: Enables retaking, version tracking
3. **Service layer for scoring**: Testable, reusable business logic
4. **JSON scoring_map**: Flexible question scoring without schema changes
5. **ONET FK relationship**: Direct joins for fast career matching queries
6. **Top 3 codes focus**: Industry standard for Holland Code interpretation
